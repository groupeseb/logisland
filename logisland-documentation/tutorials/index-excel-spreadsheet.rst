Extract Records from Excel File
===============================

In the following getting started tutorial we'll drive you through the process of extracting data from any Excel file with LogIsland platform.

Both XLSX and old XLS file format are supported.

.. note::

    Be sure to know of to launch a logisland Docker environment by reading the `prerequisites <./prerequisites.html>`_ section

Note, it is possible to store data in different datastores. In this tutorial, we will see the case of ElasticSearch only.

1. Logisland job setup
----------------------
The logisland job for this tutorial is already packaged in the tar.gz assembly and you can find it here for ElasticSearch :

.. code-block:: sh

    docker exec -i -t logisland vim conf/index-excel-spreadsheet.yml

We will start by explaining each part of the config file.

An Engine is needed to handle the stream processing. This ``conf/extract-excel-data.yml`` configuration file defines a stream processing job setup.
The first section configures the Spark engine (we will use a `KafkaStreamProcessingEngine <../plugins.html#kafkastreamprocessingengine>`_) to run in local mode with 2 cpu cores and 2G of RAM.

.. code-block:: yaml

    engine:
  component: com.hurence.logisland.engine.spark.KafkaStreamProcessingEngine
  type: engine
  documentation: Index records of an excel file with LogIsland
  configuration:
    spark.app.name: IndexExcelDemo
    spark.master: local[4]
    spark.driver.memory: 1G
    spark.driver.cores: 1
    spark.executor.memory: 2G
    spark.executor.instances: 4
    spark.executor.cores: 2
    spark.yarn.queue: default
    spark.yarn.maxAppAttempts: 4
    spark.yarn.am.attemptFailuresValidityInterval: 1h
    spark.yarn.max.executor.failures: 20
    spark.yarn.executor.failuresValidityInterval: 1h
    spark.task.maxFailures: 8
    spark.serializer: org.apache.spark.serializer.KryoSerializer
    spark.streaming.batchDuration: 1000
    spark.streaming.backpressure.enabled: false
    spark.streaming.unpersist: false
    spark.streaming.blockInterval: 500
    spark.streaming.kafka.maxRatePerPartition: 3000
    spark.streaming.timeout: -1
    spark.streaming.unpersist: false
    spark.streaming.kafka.maxRetries: 3
    spark.streaming.ui.retainedBatches: 200
    spark.streaming.receiver.writeAheadLog.enable: false
    spark.ui.port: 4050

The `controllerServiceConfigurations` part is here to define all services that be shared by processors within the whole job, here an Elasticsearch service that will be used later in the ``BulkAddElasticsearch`` processor.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - controllerService: elasticsearch_service
      component: com.hurence.logisland.service.elasticsearch.Elasticsearch_5_4_0_ClientService
      type: service
      documentation: elasticsearch service
      configuration:
        hosts: sandbox:9300
        cluster.name: es-logisland
        batch.size: 5000


Inside this engine you will run a Kafka stream of processing, so we setup input/output topics and Kafka/Zookeeper hosts.
Here the stream will read all the logs sent in ``logisland_raw`` topic and push the processing output into ``logisland_events`` topic.


We can define some serializers to marshall all records from and to a topic.
We assume that the stream will be serializing the input file as a byte array in a single record. Reason why we will use a ByteArraySerialiser in the configuration below.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # main processing stream
    - stream: parsing_stream
      component: com.hurence.logisland.stream.spark.KafkaRecordStreamParallelProcessing
      type: stream
      documentation: a processor that converts raw excel file content into structured log records
      configuration:
        kafka.input.topics: logisland_raw
        kafka.output.topics: logisland_events
        kafka.error.topics: logisland_errors
        kafka.input.topics.serializer: com.hurence.logisland.serializer.BytesArraySerializer
        kafka.output.topics.serializer: com.hurence.logisland.serializer.KryoSerializer
        kafka.error.topics.serializer: com.hurence.logisland.serializer.JsonSerializer
        kafka.metadata.broker.list: sandbox:9092
        kafka.zookeeper.quorum: sandbox:2181
        kafka.topic.autoCreate: true
        kafka.topic.default.partitions: 4
        kafka.topic.default.replicationFactor: 1

Within this stream, an ``ExcelExtract`` processor takes a byte array excel file content and computes a list of ``Record``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    # parse excel cells into records
        - processor: excel_parser
          component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.excel.ExcelExtract
          type: parser
          documentation: a parser that produce events from an excel file
          configuration:
            record.type: excel_record
            skip.rows: 1
            field.names: segment,country,product,discount_band,units_sold,manufacturing,sale_price,gross_sales,discounts,sales,cogs,profit,record_time,month_number,month_name,year


This stream will process log entries as soon as they will be queued into `logisland_raw` Kafka topics, each log will
be parsed as an event which will be pushed back to Kafka in the ``logisland_events`` topic.

.. note::

   Please note that we are mapping the excel column *Date* to be the timestamp of the produced record (*record_time* field) in order to use this as time reference in elasticsearch/kibana (see below).

The second processor  will handle ``Records`` produced by the ``ExcelExtract`` to index them into elasticsearch

.. code-block:: yaml

    # add to elasticsearch
    - processor: es_publisher
      component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.elasticsearch.BulkAddElasticsearch
      type: processor
      documentation: a processor that trace the processed events
      configuration:
        elasticsearch.client.service: elasticsearch_service
        default.index: logisland
        default.type: event
        timebased.index: yesterday
        es.index.field: search_index
        es.type.field: record_type


2. Launch the script
--------------------
For this tutorial we will handle an excel file. We will process it with an ExcelExtract that will produce a bunch of Records and we'll send them to Elastiscearch
Connect a shell to your logisland container to launch the following streaming jobs.

For ElasticSearch :

.. code-block:: sh

    docker exec -i -t logisland bin/logisland.sh --conf conf/index-excel-spreadsheet.yml

3. Inject an excel file into the system
---------------------------------------
Now we're going to send a file to ``logisland_raw`` Kafka topic.

For testing purposes, we will use `kafkacat <https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat>`_,
a *generic command line non-JVM Apache Kafka producer and consumer* which can be easily installed.

.. note::

   Sending raw files through kafka is not recommended for production use since kafka is designed for high throughput and not big message size.


The configuration above is suited to work with the example file *Financial Sample.xlsx*.

Let's send this file in a single message to LogIsland with kafkacat to ``logisland_raw`` Kafka topic

.. code-block:: sh

   kafkacat -P -t logisland_raw -v -b sandbox:9092 ./Financial\ Sample.xlsx


5. Inspect the logs
---------------------------------

Kibana
""""""

With ElasticSearch, you can use Kibana.

Open up your browser and go to `http://sandbox:5601/ <http://sandbox:5601/app/kibana#/discover?_g=(refreshInterval:(display:Off,pause:!f,value:0),time:(from:'1995-05-08T12:14:53.216Z',mode:absolute,to:'1995-11-25T05:30:52.010Z'))&_a=(columns:!(_source),filters:!(),index:'li-*',interval:auto,query:(query_string:(analyze_wildcard:!t,query:usa)),sort:!('@timestamp',desc),vis:(aggs:!((params:(field:host,orderBy:'2',size:20),schema:segment,type:terms),(id:'2',schema:metric,type:count)),type:histogram))&indexPattern=li-*&type=histogram>`_ and you should be able to explore your excel records.

Configure a new index pattern with ``logisland.*`` as the pattern name and ``@timestamp`` as the time value field.

Then if you go to Explore panel for the latest 5 years time window. You are now able to play with the indexed data.
