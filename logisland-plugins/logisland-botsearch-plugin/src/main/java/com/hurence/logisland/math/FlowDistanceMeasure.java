/**
 * In the fine-grained clustering step, we consider the structural similarity
 * among sequences of HTTP requests (as opposed to the statistical similarity
 * used for coarsegrained clustering). Our objective is to group together
 * malware that interact with Web applications in a similar way. For example, we
 * want to group together bots that rely on the same Web-based C&C application.
 * Our approach is based on the observation that two different malware samples
 * that rely on the sameWeb server application will query URLs structured in a
 * similar way, and in a similar sequence. In order to capture these
 * similarities, we first define a measure of distance between two HTTP requests
 * rk and rh
 *
 * - m represents the request method (e.g., GET, POST, HEADER, etc.). 
 * - p stands for page, namely the first part of the URL that includes the 
 * path and page name, but does not include the parameters. 
 * - n represents the set of parameter names (i.e., n = {id, version, cc} in 
 * the example in Figure 2). 
 * - v is the set of parameter values.
